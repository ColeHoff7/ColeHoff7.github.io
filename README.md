Website
========
This is a website I built so that I would have a place for a more detailed resume and a place to post projects or project ideas. It was a fun little project to build, and allowed me to learn a little bit more about website development. I used Jekyll and a Jekyll theme called Mediator as the basis for the site, and then customized it for my needs.
